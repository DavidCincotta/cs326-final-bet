# Application Overview
We have implemented a website where students can share their experiences in different courses at the University of Massachusetts.  Users can create a page for a class with a specific professor.  These course pages contain a section for helpful resources that students found during their tenure in the class, as well as a forum section where users can make text posts about their experiences and begin dialogues with past, current and future students.  Instead of simply reviewing a professor as a whole, this application focuses on specific courses in an effort to help students avoid wasting their time taking classes that will do more harm than it will help.
