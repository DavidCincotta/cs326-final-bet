# Innovative Idea

A forum for students to discuss their experiences in past and present courses, as well as a repository for helpful documents and links within each class.  This application is similar to sites such as ratemy professor, but ours is used to focus on the specific courses in the UMass curriculum.  We want to provide a place where students can get help deciding what classes they should take, with more explanation of what to expect from people who have already taken the class.  Having a better idea of what to expect in our classes makes it easier to choose which ones we actaully want to take.  During the course of our time in college, we are all faced with courses that don't seem to click for us, and we spend time finding outside sources to help ensure we learn what we need to succeed.  Our project will also act as a centralized location where students can post various resources they have found helpful in their experience of taking whatever class they wish to post about.

# Important Components

The classes in our application will be chosen and added by students themselves.  They will be able to create new forum spaces for whatever class they wish.  It is crucial in order to make one of these posts to be a UMass student.  No one without a UMass email will be able to create a class as we want to ensure that only those who have taken the class can create the class discussion area.  We will provide different sections (possible different tabs or windows) to represent the various sections of each class, such as discussion areas, important resources, and polls regarding the quality of the class structure.  There will also be a search function where one can search for a specific class, both to find information and ensure that no redundant sites are added.
