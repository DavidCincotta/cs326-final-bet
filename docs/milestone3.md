# Database Structure

This milestone began with fixing our last release, which did not run successfully on Heroku.  Tom and Ilya were baffled at first but eventually got the app succesfully running on Herkou (with some help from our UCA Bryce).  After that, Ilya helped Tom come up with the database structure and Tom created the visual display of the database, shown above.  In terms of coding, there were a few missing API endpoints that ended up being necessary which Tom and Ilya added to our server file.  For our database implementation, the functionality relating to accounts was handled by Ilya, Tom implemented the forum data tables, and David was in charge of the courses/directory database functionality.  In addition to the accounts data table, Ilya was also our authentication pioneer and handled our initial login scheme with minimal help from Tom.
